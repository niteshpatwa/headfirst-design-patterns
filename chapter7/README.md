# ADAPTER DESIGN PATTERN
- Converts the interface of a class into another inteface the client expects.
- Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible intefaces.

## Project 1: Ducks
### Example Project to learn Adapter Design Pattern

## Project 2: IterEnum
### Real world use case of Adapter Design Pattern (in java collections)

# FACADE DESIGN PATTERN
- Provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.
